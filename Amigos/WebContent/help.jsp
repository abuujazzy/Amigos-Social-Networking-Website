<font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3em" color="#F63B00">

		<a>If you don't have a Amigos account, you can sign up for one in a few easy steps. To sign up for a brand new account, enter your name, birthday, gender, and email address into the form on www.Amigos.com. Then pick a password.</a>
		<a>When you create a new password, make sure that it's at least 6 characters long. Try to use a complex combination of numbers, letters, and punctuation marks. If the password you entered isn't strong enough, try mixing together uppercase and lowercase letters or making the password longer.</a>
		<a>Pick a question and answer you know you'll remember. Keep your security question a secret. Make sure your answer is specific enough that it can't be guessed easily</a>

<a>Depending on whom you'd like to share with, there are different ways to share content on Amigos:
Sharing with a broad audience: Use the share menu that's located at the top of your homepage and timeline to let others know what's on your mind. You can update your status and share photos, videos, links and other application content. Things you share will appear as posts on your timeline, and can appear in your news feed. To control whether or not specific people have the option to view your stories, you can change the privacy settings for each piece of content you post.

Sharing with an individual: You can use the share menu at the top of a friend's timeline to write or share something on his or her timeline. Friends of your friend will also be able to view your post. If you'd like to share something privately, you can always send someone a private message.</a>
